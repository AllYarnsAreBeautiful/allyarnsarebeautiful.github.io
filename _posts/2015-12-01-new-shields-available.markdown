Dear friends of AYAB,

Since today (01.12.2015) there are AYAB-Shields available to purchase
online. This time not as prefabricated modules, but as kits for
self-soldering. But don't worry, we have removed all SMD components, so
the Shields can be build by amateur solderers.

<img src="https://shop.thinkstack.de/2-thickbox_default/ayab-shield-loet-kit.jpg" width="250">

The Kits are available for KH-910, KH-930 and KH-950 on
[shop.thinkstack.de](https://shop.thinkstack.de) (only in German for now) \\
If you're not sure, please read the soldering guide before (only in
German too, sorry. But with many pictures :).

Our AYAB software got several improvements and new features too. The
most important are:

* One-click Start -> Automatic detection of machine initialization
* Graphical display of the start / stop needles
* Graphical display of current line
* Test Mode for the machine sensors

and many more.

The new software version will be released with the next few hours.

**Important: Be sure to update the firmware of the Arduino to version 0.8
to use the self-solder shield and the new features.**

Have fun with the new AYAB software! \\
And to all AYAB newbies: Have a lot of fun during soldering. \\
We are looking forward to your pictures from AYAB-knitted Xmas-gifts
