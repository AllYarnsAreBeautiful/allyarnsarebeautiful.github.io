Finally, we are able to supply a [new version of the AYAB software](/software-and-documentation/). \\
In the last few months, we collected your error logs and feature requests and 
tried to put everything together into a new and hopefully better version.

Besides some visual improvements (visualisation of the pattern position) and 
a bunch of bug fixes (image rotation, inversion, ...), we also included some new 
features. \\
We got rid of the necessity to manually confirm when the machine is initialized, 
the software recognizes the carriage passing the left hall sensor automatically 
and starts the knitting process.

Additionally, we got a last minute feature request from Cindy, who proposed a 
dedicated mode for circular knitting (e.g. for knitting mittens). I hope she will 
supply a tutorial for this soon!

Last but not least, we had to do some changes in the firmware because of the I2C 
port expander we used on the new DIY AYAB shield. So for using the new version 
of the AYAB shield, usage of [v0.80](/software-and-documentation/) (firmware AND software) is mandatory.

Of course, there is still some work to do and lots of open issues, but we 
hope you enjoy the new version and use it for some nice projects!
