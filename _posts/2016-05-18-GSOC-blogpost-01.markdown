Hi, we are Kirstin and Nicco and for the next couple of months we will be working on the AYAB project. AYAB is an abbreviation for All Yarns Are Beautiful and the project works on the Software that interfaces with the knitting machine and directs in in what to knit. Zou can read more about the existing software in the recent blogposts.
We want to implement two new features and expand on the functionality of the software that replaces the original firmware of the knitting machine.

We want to work on an exchangeable format that stores all information necessary for knitting e.g. a sweatshirt. It should contain the sewing pattern, the color pattern(s) defined for the different parts of the knit piece and the stitch pattern, also defined for the different parts of the knit piece.

This new information that we will have through the format will allow us to create directions for the user in case the machine cannot switch yarn colors on its own or add or remove stitches, but the user can. We want the software to have on screen instructions for the user, telling the user what to do before they knit the next row. This will make knitting with more than two yarn colors possible and make it easier for users to knit shapes where they need to add and remove stitches. This is very much needed when knitting clothes.

Our next steps are to make user studies to find out about how people use the knitting machines, what is necessary and important. If you like to lend us a hand, please contact us. Also we are doing weekly hangouts in the evening, Tuesday 21:00 (Berlin, GMT+2).
