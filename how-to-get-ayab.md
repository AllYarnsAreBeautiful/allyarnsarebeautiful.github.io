## Build it yourself!
The AYAB Shield is Open Source.<br>
[Here you can find all necessary information you need (Layout, Schematics, BOM, ...).](/shield-hardware/)<br>
For PCB manufacturing you might use [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fY0Wu9ua) or [seeed studio](https://seeedstudio.com)

## Buy it!
For people which are not into PCB manufacturing and soldering, <br> you can order the new [AYAB-Interface](/ayab-interface/) at the [Evil Mad Scientists Laboratories](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/835-ayab-page) shop. <br>
We also provide a way to get self solder shield kits directly from us at the [thinkstack shop](https://shop.thinkstack.de).
