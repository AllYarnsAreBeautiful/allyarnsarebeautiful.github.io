## Build it yourself!
The AYAB Shield is Open Source.<br>
[Here you can find all necessary information you need (Layout, Schematics, BOM, ...).](/shield-hardware/)<br>
For PCB manufacturing you might use [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fY0Wu9ua) or [seeed studio](https://seeedstudio.com)

## Buy it!
For people which are not into PCB manufacturing and soldering, <br>we also provide a way to get shield kits directly from us at <a href="https://shop.thinkstack.de">the thinkstack shop</a>.
