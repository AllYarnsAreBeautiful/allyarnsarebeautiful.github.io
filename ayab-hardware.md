Basically, there are two ways to use AYAB in your machine: The AYAB shield and the AYAB interface.
Both are fully reversible as they are just substituting the original mainboard of the knitting machine.

## The difference between AYAB Shield and AYAB Interface

### [AYAB Interface](/ayab-interface/)

Luckily, the folks at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories spent some effort and redesigned the AYAB shield so it integrates
both the Arduino and the hardware on the shield to a board which fits perfectly into the knitting machine.

### [AYAB Shield](/ayab-shield/)

The AYAB shield was developed at the very beginning of the AYAB project and is a simple Arduino shield.
Over the years, it was improved further and further, and so it happens that there are several shield versions in the wild. Sadly, it is not possible to integrate the Arduino and the Shield seamlessly into the machine, so it has to stay without the original cover or the cover has to be modded.

## Where can I get one?

### Build it yourself!

Both the AYAB Shield and the AYAB Interface are Open Hardware.

### Buy it!

#### AYAB Interface

The AYAB Interface is no longer sold nor manufactured by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories.

You may find people who manufacture and sell it on the Web, but we cannot point to particular seller as of this writing.

#### AYAB Shield

The AYAB Shield is not sold directly by us, but there are some people manufacturing and selling them out there. Please double check the Shield version you are buying, so you don't get an old one. The latest version released by us is "1.4TH":
