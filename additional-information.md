Although knitting with AYAB is semi-automatic, it is still needlework and may be confusing and frustrating during the first few tries. **DO NOT GIVE UP!!**

Additionally, check the AYAB groups on [ravelry.com](http://ravelry.com) and [strickforum.de](http://strickforum.de)

For questions about the new [AYAB-Interface](/ayab-interface) visit the [EMSL Forum](http://forum.evilmadscientist.com/categories/ayab-all-yarns-are-beautiful).

And, as if it still does not work out:
